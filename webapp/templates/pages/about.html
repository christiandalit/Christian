        <p>This has been the noble objective of AICS since the very start of its operation way back in 1996. The vision of Mr. Manuel T.

AICS Commonwealth followed suit in 2008. To date, AICS hastwo more B.S. degree programs: B.S. Computer Engineering, a continuing course for its 2-year Computer Technology graduates, and B.S. Entrepreneurship, a continuing course for its 2-year Business Information Management graduates.</p>
